MySql developer
db-- Database Administrator
Sql command also called Queries
Mysql is a oracle product
Mysql is the open source
Queries can be written in uppercase and lowercase also.
Database is a which we can store the data in tables.
Group of colums make a row, tuple, 
Group of tables make a database.
Records also knows as tuple.
Open source means we download the software used for practice.
Every sql is terminated with (;).
Every query is breaked into 2-3 lines is required
Var Clause is not case sensative in sql
Table consist of minimum one column and can have many rows.
Every table in my sql is zero or one primary key.
Table have 1 rows or thousands of rows depending on business growth.
Salesnum in the column is also field called dbms.Its also called attribute in RDBMS.
Group of columns make a row.
In the same way for the DBMS group of fields make a records.
Group of attribute makes a Tuple.
Group of Tuple make a table.
Group of rows make a file.
Group of records make a table.
Excel is a spreadsheet
Example of Spreadsheet:  Excel, Visi Calc(is the first spreadsheet fathr of excel), Lotus 123, Liber Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint).
Every field/column/attribute will have data which is called datatype.
While creating MySQL table datatype has to be declared for the attribute or columns.

Commit: It means to save records
In MySQL Commit is already done.
When we add, delete, modify a record Commit is done automatically also. 

Rollback: Opposite of Commit 


Sysdate() is a date function.
In MySQL queries when we adding,modifying a records attributes of character and date datatype should be always in single quote('').
*****

It is case sensative in oracle.

select sum(comm), max(comm), min(comm)
