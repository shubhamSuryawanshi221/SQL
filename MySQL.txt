Mysql is the open source of RDBMS
Mysql will run under operating system- linux,windows,oracle
Queries are not case sensitive
Mysql versions-- 5,5.2,5.4,5.6,8
Mysql 5.5 and above is a object oriented RDBMS
MySql developer
db-- Database Administrator
Sql command also called Queries
Mysql is a oracle product
Mysql is the open source
Queries can be written in uppercase and lowercase also.
Database is a which we can store the data in tables.
Group of colums make a row, tuple, 
Group of tables make a database.
Records also knows as tuple.
Open source means we download the software used for practice.
Every sql is terminated with (;).
Every query is breaked into 2-3 lines is required
Var Clause is not case sensative in sql
Table consist of minimum one column and can have many rows.
Every table in my sql is zero or one primary key.
Table have 1 rows or thousands of rows depending on business growth.
Salesnum in the column is also field called dbms.Its also called attribute in RDBMS.
Group of columns make a row.
In the same way for the DBMS group of fields make a records.
Group of attribute makes a Tuple.
Group of Tuple make a table.
Group of rows make a file.
Group of records make a table.
Excel is a spreadsheet
Example of Spreadsheet:  Excel, Visi Calc(is the first spreadsheet fathr of excel), Lotus 123, Liber Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint).
Every field/column/attribute will have data which is called datatype.
While creating MySQL table datatype has to be declared for the attribute or columns.
Primary key is always by default NOT NULL.
Mixup of lstrim and rtrim is called trim.
Group means to group the records based on a grouping of a non primary key attribute in sql table.

***************


COMMIT: It means to save records
In MySQL Commit is already done.
When we add, delete, modify a record Commit is done automatically also. 

Rollback: Opposite of Commit 


Sysdate() is a date function.
In MySQL queries when we adding,modifying a records attributes of character and date datatype should be always in single quote('').
*****
#where clause
It is used for giving conditions to fetch the records from the table in SQL Query.
It is not case sensitive in MySQL.
It is case sensative in oracle.
*****

#Datatypes:-
Char, Varchar, numeric, Decimal, Date 
********
select sum(comm), max(comm), min(comm)
    -> from salespeople;

In the above quey we are using 3 aggregate or group by function called
sum(), max(), min()

QUERIES ==>

1)select sysdate(); / select sysdate() from dual;---> used for oracle --> dual is a logical table, dual is a compulsory in oracle SQL --> Optional in MySQL Queries.
2)show databases;
3)use databasename; -----> For Open the database
4)create database databasename;
5)create table salespeople
    -> (snum numeric(5) primary key,
    -> sname char(20),
    -> city varchar(25),
    -> comm numeric(11,2));
6)show tables;
7)desc salespeople; / describe salespeople; --> To see the structural table
8)select * from salespeople;
9)insert into salespeople values (1001, 'James Bond', 'London', 3434.34);
10)select * from salespeople where city='London';
11) select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople;
12)select * from salespeople where city='London' or city = 'Bengaluru' or city= 'India';
13)select * from salespeople where snum=1002;
14)select sum(comm), max(comm), min(comm)
    -> from salespeople;
15) select sum(comm), max(comm)
    -> from salespeople;

##Function Heading##

4 Phases of giving headings for any my sql Queries

16) select sum(comm)
    -> from salespeople;///  select sum(comm)comm
                              -> from salespeople;
17)select sum(comm) "Performance bonus"
    -> from salespeople;
18) select sum(comm) Insenivte_performance_amount
    -> from salespeople;
19)select sum(comm) as "Performance Bonus"
    -> from salespeople;

##Select Clause Hierarchy##

20) select attribute1, attribute2
    ->from table1, table2
    ->where clause
    ->group by
    ->having clause
    ->order by;
21)Write a query to display the name in upper case and salesnamecity in lower case.

select snum, upper(sname) upper, lower(city) cities, comm
    -> from salespeople;

=> upper():
In the above query we are using upper() which is a string function to convert the values in a column of the table into upper case
only in the output of the query.
=> Lower():
It is a string/text function wich will convert lower case values from the field into upper in the output query.


22)select length('All the student from this batch gets posted for a great job')
    -> from dual;

length(): It is count the length of the string/attributes/ field from table which is given in the query. It is very important function

23) select ltrim(city), sname
    -> from salespeople;

ltrim(): Is used to remove left side blank from the table.

24)select rtrim('  Bengaluru is a nice city    ') from dual;

rtrim(): Reomve the right side blank space from the string.or from attribute in the table.
it does not physically remove the table it only remove the only output in the query.

25)select upper('James bond is a nice man')
    -> from dual;
26)select lower('JAMES bOnd is A nice man')
    -> from dual;
27)select length(city) from salespeople;

In the above query the length function we print every size tuple attribute from table. whwn it is not print the value it is null value.
**********************
##Nested Function##

Function within the function is called nested function in my sql.

28)select length (rtrim('    Bengaluru is a nice city  ')) from dual;                               
29)select rtrim('    Bengaluru is a nice city  ') from dual;
30)select ltrim('    Bengaluru is a nice city  ') from dual;
31)select trim('    Bengaluru is a nice city  ') from dual;                      --> Mixup of lstrim and rtrim is called trim.
32)WAQ to fetch city wise how many salespeople are working?
 select city, count(city) "salesperson working"
    -> from salespeople
    -> group by city;                   --> Group means to group the records based on a grouping of a non primary key attribute in sql table.    
************************

## Like Operator       
--> Like operator is very important concept of mysql. it  is used for fetching records
based on the condition given in the like operator.
--> Like operator is used when we may not the full information
--> like operator is not a case sensitive in mysql.
London
LONDON
LonDoN
--> Like operator can be used all data types if required.
--> Like operators should be works faster.
--> When the size of table is more than Lakhs and millions of tupples.

            
33)WAQ to print all salespeople who placed in city whose strt with L?
 select * from salespeople
    -> where city like 'L%';
34)  select * from salespeople
    -> where comm like '4%';

## Wild cards/wild characters/meta characters
**********************************************
1)% :- is used for patterns of numeric and Characters value and dates.
2)_ :- Every underscore represent a character of string or numeric number
        or date or special characters from the table.
            
WAQ to fetch all salespeople who are posted in city where city name is of 6 charachters.
only print snum, sname and city(use like operator with '______')?
-->select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where city like '______';

Waq to print all salespeople who are posted in city which is not locateed in 6 charcters?
--> select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where city not like '______';


WAQ to print all salespeople where character is 4 letter.
-->select * from salespeople
    -> where sname like '____';
Empty set (0.00 sec)

WAQ to print all salespeople where character is 7 letter.
-->  select * from salespeople
    -> where sname like '_______';
Empty set (0.00 sec)

 select * from salespeople
    -> where comm like '____.__';

WAQ to fetch all salespeople who posted in city city name ends with i?
-->
 select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where city like '%i';

>In the above query %i means used with like operator means like operator which checks all records 
where the city name start with anything but it end with i.

select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where ltrim(city) like '%i';

select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where rtrim(city) like '%i';

select snum, sname, city
    -> from salespeople
    -> where trim(city) like '%i';

********************************
## Foreign Key 

Foregin key is a key whih is already primary key in another table.
One table can have many foreign keys.
Duplicate values are allowed.
Foreign key should not have null values (but sometmes allowed in some projets).


Create  customer table with snum as foreign key connecting to parent table salespeople;
-->
create table customers
    -> (cnum numeric(5) primary key,
    -> cname char(28),
    -> city varchar(20),
    -> snum numeric(5) references salespeople(snum));
